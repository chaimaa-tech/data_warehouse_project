# data_warehouse_project
building a modern dataWarehouse with ETL process using sql server for analytics
### üì∫ Tutorial Source
This project is based on the tutorial from [Data with Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaraa).
# Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
# üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
